abstract:
  supplied: A pigeon is brought to a stable state of hunger by reducing it to 75 percent
    of its weight when well fed. It is put into an experimental cage for a few minutes
    each day. A food hopper attached to the cage may be swung into place so that the
    pigeon can eat from it. A solenoid and a timing relay hold the hopper in place
    for five sec. at each reinforcement. If a clock is now arranged to present the
    food hopper at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior,
    operant conditioning usually takes place.The bird tends to learn whatever response
    it is making when the hopper appears. The response may be extinguished and reconditioned.
    The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves
    as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of
    food, although such a relation is lacking. Journal of Experimental Psychology,
    Vol 38(2), Apr 1948, 168-172.
